    <h1>Test - Delete Me</h1>

    <p><b>Obi-Wan Kenobi:</b> You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now, until now you've become the very thing you swore to destroy.</p>

    <p><b>Anakin Skywalker:</b> Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan! I see through the lies of the Jedi. 
    I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire.</p>

    <p><b>Obi-Wan Kenobi:</b> Your new Empire?</p>

    <p><b>Anakin Skywalker:</b> Don't make me kill you.</p>

    <p><b>Obi-Wan Kenobi:</b> Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, TO DEMOCRACY!</p>

    <p><b>Anakin Skywalker:</b> If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.</p>

    <p><b>Obi-Wan Kenobi:</b> <i>[realizing that Anakin is consumed by evil and there's no reasoning with him anymore]</i> Only a Sith deals in absolutes.</p>

    <p>[draws his lightsaber]</p>

    <p><b>Obi-Wan Kenobi:</b> I will do what I must.</p>

    <p><b>Anakin Skywalker:</b> You will try.</p>

    <p><i>[draws his lightsaber and confronts Obi-Wan]</i></p>
